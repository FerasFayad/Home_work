/* Question 7
Given this code, identify any errors and explain why they occur:
 ```dart void main() { String name = "Alice"; name = 123; print(name); } ```

 Solution 
  it'll give me error that can't be reassigned  a variable to type of int because the name is defined 
  as a String and stored in RAM as a String so can't be other data type 
*/
// void main() {
//    String name = "Alice";
//     name = 123; 
//     print(name);
//    }
