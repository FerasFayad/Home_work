/*Question 13
What will be the output of this code snippet? Explain your answer:
 ```dart void main() { int x = 5; int y = x + 2 * 3; print(y); } ```
 */
void main() {
   int x = 5; int y = x + 2 * 3;
    print(y); 
    /*the the code exeuted first with multiplication operator because in math logic is stronger than the process of addition
    (2*3) = 6
    x = 5
   (6+5 = 11) and the result of multiplication process will be added to x value
    */
