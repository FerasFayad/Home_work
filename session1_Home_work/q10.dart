/* Question 10
Explain what happens if you try to use a variable before it is declared in Dart.*/

/*Solution
The code will give an error because the variable doesn’t exist yet. 
You have to declare it first before you can use it  because Dart is a statically typed language, 
and variables must be declared before they are used..*/
