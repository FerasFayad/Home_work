/*Question 15
What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language, 
and how does it impact the way variables are used? */

/* solution 
Dart is statically-typed, which means when you make a variable, its type is set and can’t change. 
This stops mistakes like putting the wrong type in a variable and makes your code easier to read.
